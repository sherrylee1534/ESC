# ESC Indoor Tracking Projects. Class 4 Group 8
### General Steps
To start up the app, I will use dagger hilt to create various module  
Den the architecture used will still b mvvm  
Den create a module for the api n inject into either the viewmodel or the activity  
Nid to see code samples fr google  
To make the ui gd its either a 2d map or a 3d map  
2d map is the traditional google maps with the blue dot  
Or the 3d map is using the camera to show the location
